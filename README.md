# Weather Widget

## Completed

Ability for end user to view the weather in their current location from an aesthetically pleasing interface. User can view daily high and low as well as current weather information. Current weather information includes abbreviated description as well as a long version describing current conditions. Interface can also be used on mobile. ES6 async await was utilized to try to keep functionality modern.

## Future Additions

All of my home machines are running Ubuntu and therefore cross-browser testing for Safari was not completed.

Additionally going forward I would make some UI changes to allow the error messages to be displayed on screen for the user as opposed to simply printed to the console. It would also be nice to include a loading spinner as the page pulls up the information and to allow for background changes depending on the time of day, eg day/night.

I did not create a server given that external tooling was prohibited. Testing was also excluded for this reason. 

## Total Time
